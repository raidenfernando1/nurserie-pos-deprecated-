To those who wander here after us

Beware.
This codebase is not what it seems.

It breathes in mysterious ways, bound by duct tape, nicotine, and the trembling hands of those who came before you.
You will find inconsistencies — things that *should not work* yet *do*, and things that *should* work but *never will*.
Do not anger the spirits. Do not rename the ancient variables. Do not refactor what slumbers.

There are files untouched since the dawn of our first deploy.
Comments written in despair.
Functions that call themselves for reasons forgotten.
Tabs and spaces locked in eternal war.
A linter that obeys no man.

If you must change something, whisper a prayer, commit thrice, and push once.
And when it breaks — for it *will* break — know that it was not your fault.
It never was.

Beware of its intricies it will drive mad, insane even! this codebase was forged through
blood, sweat and tears if you must recite a prayer to the omnissiah and the emperium of man
for you will definitely need it.

Signed in code and blood,
— Raiden, Jovan
